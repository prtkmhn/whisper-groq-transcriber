2. Bachelor of Technology, Computer Science and Engineering — PES University, Bangalore, KA, India Jul 2015 - Aug 2019
WORK EXPERIENCE
1. Software Engineer II — VMware Inc., India Jul 2019 - Jul 2022
• Pioneered the automation of vSphere deployments by harnessing VMware’s proprietary APIs, achieving a streamlined infrastructure setup
process that resulted in a 90% reduction in deployment timeframes for vCenters, ESXi hosts, and various storage systems including VMFS,
vSAN, NFS, and VVols.
• Engineered and refined Kubernetes setups on VMware vSphere, leading to a 30% quicker deployment via automation and CI/CD pipeline
improvements. This also resulted in a 75% reduction in rollback occurrences, attributed to enhanced testing and quality checks.
• Orchestrated the seamless integration of VMware vSphere Container Storage Plug-in with Kubernetes, delivering a 35% increase in storage
efficiency and a 20% cost reduction. My technical expertise also halved incident resolution times and reinforced system reliability, ensuring
high availability and performance.
2. Software Engineering I — VMware Inc., India Jan 2019 - Jul 2019
• Created a Java-based validation tool for vSphere datacenter configurations, enhancing layout accuracy by 62% and conserving over 20 hours
per week previously spent on manual checks.
• Conducted a thorough analysis and refinement of data center lifecycle management processes, leading to a 15% savings in storage resource
allocation and a 25% faster resource deployment.
• Employed Tanzu Observability by Wavefront for in-depth analytics on vSphere infrastructure, enhancing monitoring efficiency by 45% and
accelerating performance troubleshooting by 50%.
3. Research Intern — University of California, Irvine, CA Jul 2018 - Aug 2018
• Architected a real-time Environmental Health Monitoring system by integrating disparate environmental data streams, including CO, NO2,
O3, PM2.5, PM10, and SO2 levels, into a unified health metric dashboard powered by Open Street Maps API. This innovative solution enables
immediate monitoring and data-driven decision-making for personalized respiratory and cardiovascular health during outdoor exercise events.
• Optimized data collection using cutting-edge API technology, such as the Strava Data API, reducing data inconsistencies by 27% and improving
accuracy by 35%. Integrated heart rate data for precise breathing volume estimation, mapped with local air quality sensors via constant GPS
tracking.
• Developed a novel cigarette intake equivalent metric by analyzing air pollution data and individual breathing rates, contributing to improved
public health research.The methodology and results are documented in a research paper available on arXiv.
